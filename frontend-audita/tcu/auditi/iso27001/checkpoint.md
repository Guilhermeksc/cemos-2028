At this check point you now have
• A Branded Pack that is branded to your company
• Document owners assigned for the ISMS
• Control owners assigned for the ANNEX A Controls
• The required roles and responsibilities for the ISMS assigned
• The Management Review Team assigned
• An understanding of the requirements of ISO 27001 and how the pack addresses those requirements. Where to find that information.


Document Who You Are and What You Have

In the last section you allocated owners to documents in the Information Security Management System Document Tracker.

Now is the time to go ahead and complete the documents.

Either assigning to the document owner or working with the document owner review each document, updating the variables (see section above) as required and filling in the required information.

To help you there are video guides provided on each significant document.


Organisation Overview
1 Context of Organisation / 1 Organisation Overview
The organisation overview is straightforward information about you, that you already
know about you. You may have it in different locations, or some of it, or none of it.
Now is the time to collate it into one document. We are making a link between who
we are and the information security management system we have built.
When we built it, did we consider our business objectives? Our strategy? Our
locations. Simple stuff but you want to draw a link and demonstrate it.
